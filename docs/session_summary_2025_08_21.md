# Session Summary - 21 August 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on resolving issues with Alembic migrations for the Pinox project. The primary goal was to successfully apply database migrations and ensure the database schema was updated correctly.

## Progress Report
1. **Initial Issues**:
   - Encountered `KeyError: 'url'` due to missing database URL in Alembic configuration.
   - Resolved by explicitly setting the database URL in `env.py`.

2. **Module Import Errors**:
   - Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `services` module by updating the `PYTHONPATH` dynamically in `env.py`.

3. **SQLite Database Access Issues**:
   - Faced repeated `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file` errors due to directory and permission restrictions.
   - Resolved by:
     - Testing with an in-memory database.
     - Manually creating the database file.
     - Updating permissions for the file and directory.
     - Finally, switching to a temporary directory (`/tmp/`) for the database, which resolved the issue.

4. **Successful Migration**:
   - Successfully applied all migrations using the database located at `/tmp/persistent_database.db`.

## Milestone Reached
- **Database Migrations Applied**: All Alembic migrations were successfully applied, marking a significant milestone in the project setup.

## Plan for the Next Session
1. **Database Verification**:
   - Inspect the database schema and data to ensure correctness.
   - Test the `/api/v1/jobs` endpoint to validate the integration with the database.

2. **Permanent Database Setup**:
   - Decide on a permanent location for the database and ensure it is accessible.

3. **Further Development**:
   - Continue implementing and testing other features as outlined in the project plan.
