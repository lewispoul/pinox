## Rules
- Do **not** switch to IAM 2.0 tasks in this workspace.  
- Follow the **Nox Finalization Checklist** in strict logical order.  
- Do **not** start unrelated tasks without explicit approval.


## Development Guidelines

- Always work in **logical progress order** as described in the Nox Finalization Checklist (Sections 1 → 2 → 3 → 4).
- For incomplete sections, finish **all possible subtasks** before moving to the next section.
- Avoid starting multiple unrelated changes in one commit — group changes by feature or section.
- Use consistent code style and follow the existing linting rules.
- When making changes to TypeScript or React components:
  - Keep imports organized.
  - Write or update type definitions as needed.
  - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing.
- If encountering missing production credentials or external resources, **stub them with safe placeholders** and document what is missing.
- Document all changes in the progress report at the end of each task.
- Before stopping work, leave the repository in a buildable, runnable state.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Workflow Rules (Persistent)

Always follow these rules when working in this repository:

* **Never** run the API server and tests in the same terminal.
* To start the API server, always run:

  ```bash
  ./dev.sh api
  ```

  and keep this running in its **own dedicated terminal**.

### ✅ Running Tests

* To run **all tests**, always open a **new terminal** and use:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

* To run a **specific test file**, use:

  ```bash
  make test TEST=tests/path/to/file.py
  ```

* To run tests with a **keyword filter**, use:

  ```bash
  make test TEST=-k keyword
  ```

### 📌 Important Notes

* Copilot must never start the API server and tests in the same session.
* Treat `./dev.sh api` as the only allowed way to start the API server.
* All testing must be run in a **separate terminal** from the API process.
